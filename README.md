# My Second Git Project 🚀  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains my second project, where I applied **data cleaning techniques** using Microsoft Excel and practiced **version control** with Git and GitHub. The goal was to transform a raw dataset into a structured and refined format while reinforcing my workflow for tracking changes and managing files effectively.

## Assignment Breakdown  

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning in Excel** 📊  
This phase focused on applying fundamental data cleaning techniques to improve the quality of a dataset.  

✅ **Downloaded the dataset** – The starting point of the assignment.  
✅ **Followed a tutorial** – Learned best practices for cleaning and structuring data.  
✅ **Sorted and filtered data** – Organized the dataset for better readability and analysis.  
✅ **Applied conditional formatting** – Highlighted key values for improved data visualization.  
✅ **Used text functions** – Leveraged `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, and `CONCATENATE` to refine text data.  
✅ **Removed duplicates and handled missing values** – Ensured data accuracy and completeness.  
✅ **Saved the final cleaned dataset** – Exported the refined file as **"Cleaned_Data_Isaac_Adeyeye.xlsx"**.

### **2️⃣ Git & GitHub Workflow** 🖥️  
To integrate version control into the project, I followed standard Git and GitHub practices.  

✅ **Initialized a Git repository** – Set up version control for tracking changes.  
✅ **Committed changes systematically** – Maintained a structured workflow.  
✅ **Pushed updates to GitHub** – Uploaded project files to a remote repository.
